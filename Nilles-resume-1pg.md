EMPLOYMENT HISTORY \hrulefill
==================

### Research Assistant in UIUC CS Department \hfill  {\footnotesize Aug. 2015 - May 2020}

- Explored motion planning strategies (RRT, exact geometric planners,
uncertainty modelling, stability analysis) for mobile robots that deliberately contact
environment boundaries.
- Developed interactive simulation and visualization programs in Python and
Haskell, including interfaces with C++ ROS backends.
- Disseminated results in peer-reviewed publications and conference
presentations.
- Managed and mentored ten student researchers over five years on software
and hardware projects.

### Teaching Assistant for ECE 470 (Introduction to Robotics) \hfill {\footnotesize Aug. 2019 - Dec. 2019}

- Solo instructor for weekly laboratory section (15 students). Guest lectured for two 75-minute lectures on forward kinematics (~90 students).
- Expanded course content on probability, filtering, estimation, motion
planning, robot kinematics and dynamics. Wrote homework and exam problems using online
coursework platform PrairieLearn.

### Research Intern at Petronics (Sprite Robotics)  \hfill {\footnotesize May 2016 - Aug. 2016}

- Worked with 3-5 engineers on development of a small, agile, robot cat toy.
- Configured a ROS server and added a Wi-Fi module to the robot
to stream data.
- Developed Python program to compare robot pose estimates with ground truth from motion capture.
- Analyzed how the robot slipped on
different surfaces to improve low-level controllers.
