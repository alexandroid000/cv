As a young robotics researcher, it amazes me to realize the changes that
have swept the field in recent history - the increasing capabilities of hardware manufacturing,
computational systems, and new sensors are transforming robots from academic
curiousities and constrained factory tools to a real technology which will
have impacts on many facets of our human experience. I feel incredibly lucky to be
beginning my career now, and also feel compelled to structure my research around
the development of robotics as a field in itself, by tackling fundamental
questions about the nature and capability of robotic systems.

My primary research goal is to improve the state-of-the-art abstractions and
tools for modelling, programming and making guarantees about the behavior of
robotic systems. Specifically, I approach this broad goal through the lens of
*minimality* - by exploring what tasks can be completed by robots with very
limited sensing, actuation, and computational capabilities, we gain a better
understanding of the fundamental informational requirements of robot tasks. We
are also forced to more carefully define what robotic *tasks* are, and how they
can be defined in a platform-invariant way.

I am also very interested in the robot design process itself,
and my research aims to enable human designers to think about and express robot
designs at a higher level, enhancing human creative capacity and making these technologies
more accessible.

Towards these goals, I have several ongoing research projects.

**Bouncing Robots** - describe briefly

we are analyzing the dynamics of a robot which can move in straight lines
and rotate itself to align relative to the normal vector at an environment
boundary. By finding limit cycles and other stable dynamics, we can use very
simple control laws which cause the robot to "patrol" the space and aid in
localization (by restricting what parts of the space the robot can be present in
after a certain number of collisions with the boundary). By finding chaotic or
unstable regions of the robot's dynamics, we can make "exploratory" algorithms
and make guarantees about how well the robot will cover the space.

**Self Assembly / Directed Aggregation** - describe briefly, w/ info spaces focus

**Improv**

I am also developing a project, in collaboration with Drs. Amy LaViers and
Mattox Beckman, which is a high-level programming language for describing and
controlling robot motion. This tool aims to be an easy-to-use interface for ROS
(Robot Operating System), the prevailing control architecture in robotics. I am
focusing on principled design of motion composition operators and motion
transformations, taking guidance from the movement analysis and dance
communities.
