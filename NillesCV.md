TEACHING EXPERIENCE
===================

### Research Mentoring

I have supervised and mentored eleven undergraduate students on research in the
Motion Strategy Lab in the 5.5 years of my PhD. I co-authored papers with
five of these students, and three of my mentees have gone onto PhD programs in
robotics or related fields at top universities. The rest are either still
completing their education or have obtained competitive software engineering
positions in industry.

### Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Robotics

For the Fall 2019 semester, I was one of five teaching assistants for ECE 470:
Introduction to Robotics. This was an upper level 90-student class with lecture
and lab components, and covered topics such as state estimation and filtering, forward and
inverse kinematics, motion planning and controls. I supervised a 15-student lab section and gave two guest
lectures for the full class. I also helped develop automatically generated
homework and test problems using the online learning platform PrairieLearn.

PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES
=======================

-   President of Computer Science Graduate Students Organization (2017 -
    2018).
    - Organized social events, communicated with department administration 
    about graduate student needs, assisted in organizing annual prospective PhD
    student visit weekend.
-   Reviewer for IROS '17, '18, '19, '20; ICRA '18, '19, '20; EAAI '17; CGTA '19
-   Program Committee Member for MRS '19
-   Co-organizer for 2017 Robotic Science and Systems (RSS) full day workshop,
    "Minimality and Trade-offs in Automated Robot Design." July 16 2017.
    - Recruited and communicated with speakers, helped develop materials (The
      Robot Design Game, \url{http://robot-design.org/}), facilitated workshop
      and discussions.
-   Head of student committee organizing an internal Robotics@UIUC seminar (Fall
    2016).
    - Recruited student speakers, advertised talks, maintained wiki with schedule
      and speaker slides.

OTHER EMPLOYMENT
==================

### Petronics internship: Development of small, agile mobile robot

Description:
:   Worked closely with engineers to develop hardware and
software for their mobile platform. Configured a ROS server and added a wifi module to the robot
to stream data through ROS. Analyzed the resulting data using Python, to
compare streaming pose estimates from the robot with a ground truth from a
motion capture system (also ROS-integrated). Analyzed how the robot slipped on
different surfaces to help improve low-level controllers.

Dates:
:   May 2016 - August 2016

### Complexity Sciences Center, UC Davis: Implementing Predicted Information Gain Algorithms

Description:
:   While working in Dr. Jim Crutchfield's group, I successfully implemented an
    information-theoretic learning algorithm for exploratory robots with limited
    sensing capabilities. I also researched ways to include more memory in the
    learning algorithm.

Dates:
:   June - Aug 2014

### Colorado School of Mines Math Learning Center

Description:
:   Tutor five hours a week for all classes in Math department.  Primarily
    calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra.

### North American Network of Science Labs Online (NANSLO)

Description:
:   Developed, monitored, and troubleshot remote-controlled robotic physics,
    chemistry, and biology experiments for college students in online classes.
    Served as a TA and equipment technician while classes were running.

Dates:
:   Feb 2012 - May 2014

### Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

Description:
:   Washington Internships for Students of
    Engineering (WISE) program: researched smart grid data management and policy alternatives; published an
    overview and policy recommendation in the *WISE Journal of Engineering and
    Public Policy*.
