PREVIOUS POSITIONS
==================

### Petronics internship: Development of small, agile mobile robot

Description:
:   Over the summer, I worked with Petronics to develop hardware and
software for their mobile platform. I helped add a wifi module to the robot
which streamed data to a ROS server, which I also helped set up and configure. I
wrote software for collecting and analyzing the resulting data. The goal was to
compare streaming pose estimates from the robot with a ground truth from a
motion capture system (also ROS-integrated), to analyze how the robot slipped on
different surfaces and learn better controllers.

Dates:
:   May 2016 - August 2016

### UC Davis REU: Implementing Predicted Information Gain Algorithms

Description:
:   While working in Dr. Jim Crutchfield's group, I successfully implemented an
    information-theoretic learning algorithm for exploratory robots with limited
    sensing capabilities. I also researched ways to include more memory in the
    learning algorithm.

Dates:
:   June - Aug 2014

### Colorado School of Mines Math Learning Center

Description:
:   Tutor five hours a week for all classes in Math department.  Primarily
    calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra.

Dates:
:   Jan 2015 - May 2015

### North American Network of Science Labs Online (NANSLO)

Description:
:   Developed, monitored, and troubleshot remote-controlled robotic physics,
    chemistry, and biology experiments for college students in online classes.
    Served as a TA and equipment technician while classes were running.

Dates:
:   Feb 2012 - May 2014

### Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

Description:
:   Researched smart grid data management and policy alternatives; published an
    overview and policy recommendation in the *WISE Journal of Engineering and
    Public Policy*. Was part of the Washington Internships for Students of
    Engineering (WISE) program.
