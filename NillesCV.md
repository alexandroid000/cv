OTHER EMPLOYMENT
==================

### Petronics internship: Development of small, agile mobile robot

Description:
:   Worked closely with engineers to develop hardware and
software for their mobile platform. Configured a ROS server and added a wifi module to the robot
to stream data through ROS. Analyzed the resulting data using Python, to
compare streaming pose estimates from the robot with a ground truth from a
motion capture system (also ROS-integrated). Analyzed how the robot slipped on
different surfaces to help improve low-level controllers.

Dates:
:   May 2016 - August 2016

### Complexity Sciences Center, UC Davis

Description:
:   NSF REU with Dr. Jim Crutchfield. I successfully implemented an
    information-theoretic learning algorithm for exploratory robots with limited
    sensing capabilities. I also researched ways to include more memory in the
    learning algorithm.

Dates:
:   June - Aug 2014


### Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

Description:
