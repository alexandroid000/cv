Up until the last
decade or two, a graduate student choosing to develop hardware platforms was
essentially choosing to add several years to their expected graduation date.
Now, researchers routinely have access to off-the-shelf platforms such as
mobile robots, drones, and manipulators. Development of new robots is becoming
much more accessible, given rapid manufacturing techniques. There has been an
explosion in industrial activity around personal robots, increasing automation
of manufacturing and logistics, and autonomous vehicles; one can see the
effects from this in the increasing industrial sponsorship of robotics
conferences and direct industrial-academic collaborations.

What, then, is the role of the academic roboticist? If one can go work at a
company that is directly creating useful robots, why
stay in academia, where we mainly focus on making prototypes and demonstrating
techniques that may or may not ever get picked up for more widespread use? The
answer lies in two areas where commercial enterprise cannot, by its very nature,
succeed: education, and valuing basic research toward long-term research goals.

I am pursuing an academic career in robotics because I feel a strong
responsibility to 1) educate the next generation of roboticists and engineers;
and 2) imagine what robotic technology could look like decades from now, and strive 
to bring the field toward that point. These goals can be aided by collaboration with 
industry and hopefully lead to widely-adopted advances in technology, but they 
require an academic environment. I am
applying to the Mavis Future Faculty Fellowship in the hope of meeting
like-minded graduate students, faculty, and developing the skills I need to be an
effective research professor.


### Goal 1: Become a More Effective Educator

The first reason I am interested in an academic career is because of the focus,
found in no other institutions, on education. To me, education and research are
inextricably linked. The goal of the researcher is to identify
problems that are exciting and useful, which will attract students, and their
understanding of the field to the point where it can be clearly explained to new students.

Starting in my undergraduate
degree, I was a part time tutor in the Math Learning Center and helped found and
design a "Physics Help Session" program which was focused on teaching physicists
foundational computational tools such as Python, Linux, and version control.
At UIUC, I have been mentoring undergraduates since my first year, for a total
of at least seven students who I have worked with for a semester or more
each. The first undergraduate I mentored here has gone on to study Mechatronics
at the University of Michigan; several more are graduating this year and
starting PhD programs in the fall. One of these was a co-author on a publication
at the Workshop for Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics; and several more
publications are under preparation with undergraduate co-authors.

Collaborating closely with undergraduates and seeing their personal and
professional growth has been immensely rewarding. My approach in teaching and
mentoring is to identify what truly interests students and let that guide how I
teach or what projects they work on. My role when working with undergraduates in
our lab is mainly to assist in the process of breaking down a long-term goal
into small, achievable tasks. I also help them identify skills they need to
develop, such as programming, reading papers, presenting technical results, etc.

The part of an academic career that excites me the most is to continue
becoming a better mentor and teacher, by leading my own research group
and teaching more structured classes. I am greatly inspired by my advisor, who
is one of the best teachers I have encountered due to his ability to distill
ideas down into clear and simple examples, and due to his raw enthusiasm for
robotics. The Mavis fellowship would be an opportunity to intentionally 
develop these skills, practice them in the classroom, and learn more about 
how be an effective educator. I am specifically interested in TAing and helping
with course development for Introdution to Robotics, and related robotics and 
control theory courses, with an emphasis on lab experiments, algorithms, and
information-processing.

### Goal 2: Become a More Effective Researcher

Along with teaching and mentoring, my main career goal is to continue to work on
problems that expand our foundational understanding of how to model, control,
and interact with robotic systems. Just as basic research in physics and optics
laid the theoretical foundation for the invention of the laser and all our
related technologies, basic research into the design and control of robotic
systems should aim to lay the foundation for many different creative
technologies.

However, robotics as a whole largely lacks clearly articulated
theoretical foundations, though many people are working to remedy this. For
example, robotic tasks such as grasping objects and navigating a
cluttered office building may appear very different, and in the early years of
robotics these problems had fragile solutions without robust guarantees on
behavior. However, in the 90s and early 2000s, motion planning emerged as a
formalism where the same toolbox can offer solutions to many different robotic
tasks, with guarantees on completeness, correctness, and optimality. The
progress of motion planning is inspiring; however, as we move forward, our
existing motion planning techniques are unable to solve problems with 
high degrees of uncertainty, whether that is due to a dynamic environment, 
limited sensor information, or uncharacterized dynamics.
To help bridge this gap, I have been focusing my research on underactuation,
compliance, and information spaces, as better understanding in these
areas can help us reliably control robots in challenging
environments with new forms of actuation and sensing. I have been publishing
regularly on projects in these areas at top-tier robotics conferences such as
IROS and WAFR. The main benefit I hope to get out of the Mavis program in this area is help 
learning how to pitch my research interests to different audiences, especially
during the academic interview process, and how to write grants in these areas.

### Goal 3: Become a More Effective Community Member

I have also been intentionally developing skills that will help me run an
effective research group in the future; such as lab infrastructure management,
meeting facilitation, and experimental rigor. The most important research skill
I am working to develop is community building and collaboration. Research is not
done by a lone scientist in a vacuum; by building up my community, everyone
benefits from an environment where people are supported in their work. I have
been practicing this community-building at the scale of my research group by
mentoring undergraduates and maintaining our lab space; at the scale of the
university by running a semester-long internal seminar for robotics graduate
students; and at the scale of the robotics community as a whole through peer
review and activities such as co-organizing the workshop on "Minimality and
Trade-offs in Automated Robot Design" at RSS 2017. As part of organizing that
workshop, we created the "Robot Design Game," an informal card game that helps
people explore choices in robot design and modelling as well as helps facilitate 
social interactions. I am interested in learning more about how to effectively
balance my energy between research, teaching, and service.

From all these experiences, I am convinced that I can best use my skills and
energy as a research professor in robotics. The Mavis Future Faculty Fellowship 
would be a unique opportunity to join with other researchers across
disciplines, where we can support each other in our goal to become the best faculty we can be.
