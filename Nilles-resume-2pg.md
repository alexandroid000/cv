EMPLOYMENT HISTORY \hrulefill
==================

### Research Assistant in UIUC CS Department \hfill  {\footnotesize Aug. 2015 - May 2020}

- Researched hierarchical controllers for underactuated mobile robots that explicitly use
robot-boundary interactions as a motion strategy.
- Designed, implemented, and analyzed a novel, exact, nondeterministic planning algorithm for
our model of robot-boundary interactions.
- Characterized robot trajectories as discrete dynamical systems (mathematically
and programmatically identified attractors, regions of attraction,
convergence rates).
- Developed interactive simulation and visualization programs in Python and
Haskell.
- Shared results in peer-reviewed publications and conference
presentations.
- Managed and mentored over ten undergraduate researchers over five years.

### Teaching Assistant for ECE 470 (Introduction to Robotics) \hfill {\footnotesize Aug. 2019 - Dec. 2019}

- Solo instructor for weekly laboratory section (15 students). Lectured on necessary
background in laboratory and programming skills. Facilitated as students
completed the lab. Graded lab reports.
- Expanded course content on probability, filtering, estimation, motion
planning, robot kinematics and dynamics. Wrote homework and exam problems using online
coursework platform PrairieLearn.
- Guest lectured for two 75-minute lectures on forward kinematics (class of ~90 students).
- Held office hours (3 hr/week) for labwork and coursework.

### Research Intern at Petronics (Sprite Robotics)  \hfill {\footnotesize May 2016 - Aug. 2016}

- Contributed to development of a small, agile, robotic cat toy.
- Configured a ROS server and added a wifi module to the robot
to stream data through ROS.
- Wrote Python program to compare robot pose estimates with ground truth from motion capture.
- Analyzed how the robot slipped on
different surfaces to improve low-level controllers.

### Tutor at Colorado School of Mines Math Learning Center \hfill {\footnotesize Jan. 2015 - May 2015}

- Tutored drop-in students five hours a week for all undergraduate classes in Math department.  Primarily
    calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra.


### Research Intern at Complexity Sciences Center, UC Davis \hfill {\footnotesize June 2014 - Aug. 2014}

- Implemented an information-theoretic learning algorithm for robots with limited
    sensing capabilities.
- Researched how to efficiently represent sensor histories in the
    learning algorithm.

### Laboratory Technician at NANSLO \hfill {\footnotesize Feb. 2012 - May 2014}

- Developed, monitored, and troubleshot remote-controlled robotic physics,
    chemistry, and biology experiments for college students in online classes.
- Served as a TA and equipment technician while classes were running.
